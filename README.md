# Seen (Google Glass application)

Seen is a revolutionary application that couples new and old ideas to create a truly amazing experience. 

Seen uses Google Glass's intuitive interface to streamline the way we share pictures, with just three words ,"Okay Glass, Seen", you are able to take a picture and upload to a website for the world to see  and interact with in under 1.5 seconds. 
The pictures are upload and can be accessed at https://seenoz.tk all you have to do is create a username and password (no email required) and see what the world is sharing.

NOTE: this app will not work with the code provided unless you add a -- Parse.initialize(this,"******","******"); -- to
the SeenApplication.java file in the project. This line was excluded for security reasons.
