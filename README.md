# Seen (Google Glass application)

Seen is a revolutionary application that couples new and old ideas to create a truly amazing experience. 

Seen uses Google Glass's intuitive interface to streamline the way we share pictures, with just three words ,"Okay Glass, Seen", you are able to take a picture and upload to a website for the world to see  and interact with in under 1.5 seconds. 
The pictures are upload and can be accessed at https://seenoz.tk all you have to do is create a username and password (no email required) and see what the world is sharing.

Goal: 
Create a killer photo sharing application that abides by Google Glass's design principles and "giving you what you want, when you want it, and getting out of the way." Our goal is to take the photo sharing experience to next level by making it fast, non-intrusive and extremely easy. To minimize what you have to do in the glass itself, you set your sharing preferences, public (anyone with an account can see it) or private (only friends can see it), on the website or mobile application. Then all you have to do is say "ok glass, seen", accept the picture and the rest is taken care of.   

NOTE: this app will not work with the code provided unless you add a -- Parse.initialize(this,"******","******"); -- to
the SeenApplication.java file in the project. This line was excluded for security reasons.

#Developers

We are an ambitious small agile software development team with a current focus on Google Glass applications. This team the Scrum methodology to ensure that we deliver quality products in a timely fashion.
